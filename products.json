The Greylock partner wasn’t disappointed.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Bipul Sinha, drew Rubrik’s plan to revamp the data management and recovery market on a whiteboard. “The old versus new architecture he presented was very compelling,” Chandna said. “Based on my knowledge of the sector, I knew it could be built into a large business.”\n\n“The longer I do what I do, the more I fundamentally believe that venture is a people business,” said Chandna, who has been an investor for over 20 years and has an enviable track record of successful exits. He has helped incubate Palo Alto Networks in Greylock’s offices and was on the nearly $100 billion-worth company’s board until last year. Chandna was also an early investor in AppDynamics, Sumo Logic and Arista Networks.\n<h1>oiii</h1>","slug":"download-windows","createdAt":"26/04/24, 20:34:30","published":true},{"id":"7e2c6870-5572-49f5-b670-5326a89e1ff9","name":"When Asheem Chandna drove up to Rubrik’s office in a Palo A3","price":"23","bodyContent":"When Asheem Chandna drove up to Rubrik’s office in Palo A3\n\nWhen Asheem Chandna drove up to Rubrik’s office in a Palo A3\n\n\nWhen Asheem Chandna drove up to Rubrik’s office in a Palo A3\n\n\nWhen Asheem Chandna drove up to Rubrik’s office in a Palo A3\n","slug":"when-asheem-chandna-drove-up-to-rubriks-office-in-a-palo-a3","createdAt":"26/04/24, 22:19:37","published":false}]
